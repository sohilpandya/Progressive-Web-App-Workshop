- Convincing Clients about why PWA  

**What do you want to learn during the workshop?**

### Why Build Progressive Web Apps.
- Capability vs Reach (greater reach than Capability at the moment, but capability is improving without letting go of the reach)
    - The Washington Post PWA is a great example
- PWA removes friction

### What was missing on the web?
- Reliable Performance - Service Workers ( caching, offline and improve performance )
    - amp-install-serviceworker
    - [lighthouse (tool for helping you build PWA)](github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse)
- Push Notifications
- Homescreen icon metadata
- Web Payment API (coming soon)
- Credential API (coming soon)

### Why is this important?
- Reach
    - 1 Billion Chrome Users
    - More monthly unique visitors on Web, but less engagement compared to native apps at the moment
- Acquisition
    - user Acquisition cost is lower £0.20p vs £3.00 for native
- Conversion
    - AliExpress - 2x more page views, 74% increase in time spent on pages etc.

### How do we get started?
- Start from the ground up
    - Konga.com is a great example. another one...
- Build a simple version
    - [AirBerlin](Airberlin.com) (loadtime is < 1s)
    - [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) (loadtime is <80ms)
- Focus on a single feature at a time
    - Weather Channel brought in push notifications
    - [Booking.com](booking.com)
    - **they are just showing off all the apps built using PWA now...**

### Where to Start?
- Understand your users
    - Who?
    - What Platforms?
    - What kind of connectivity?
    - How data cost affects users? (mainly for emerging market or roaming market)?
        - Data budgets, data size and data cost (again for emerging markets)
    - target/current audience?
    - Browsers/OS/Harware?  
- Connectivity
    - Cell, Wifi, Broadband?
    - unreliable, low-bandwidth, capped..?
    - offline?  
- Context is everything
- Understanding requirements
    - Performance
    - Content
    - Functionality

### Exercise time  
**For your App idea**
- Who are your users?
- What are your platforms?
- What connectivities will your users have?
- What data costs will your users have to worry about?
- Speeds?
    - Most people will abandon the page if it doesn't load within 3 seconds.
    - if it takes more than 1 second to do something, it breaks the users train of thoughts
    - under 100ms - our brain reads it as instantaneous

**Content Design**
- How to write for the Web
- How people read
- Text, images and media for the Web
- prioritise Content
- Think app!

**Data Desgign**
- Reduce data costs
- Reducer resource request
- why do these matter?
- What can I do about it?
- Text, images and media

**Code Design**
- Structure is a must
- Use HTML - then CSS and then Javascript only if required.
- HTML Structure
- Validation of you code at every step

**Responsive Design**
- Responsiveness is a core feature of the web!
- Think about layout, responsive content, delivering images in different sizes
- UI/UX for buttons and contents
