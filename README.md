### Why Build Progressive Web Apps.
- Capability vs Reach (greater reach than Capability at the moment, but capability is improving without letting go of the reach)
    - The Washington Post PWA is a great example
- PWA removes friction

### What was missing on the web?
- Reliable Performance - Service Workers ( caching, offline and improve performance )
    - amp-install-serviceworker
    - [lighthouse (tool for helping you build PWA)](github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse)
- Push Notifications
- Homescreen icon metadata
- Web Payment API (coming soon)
- Credential API (coming soon)

### Why is this important?
- Reach
    - 1 Billion Chrome Users
    - More monthly unique visitors on Web, but less engagement compared to native apps at the moment
- Acquisition
    - user Acquisition cost is lower £0.20p vs £3.00 for native
- Conversion
    - AliExpress - 2x more page views, 74% increase in time spent on pages etc.

### How do we get started?
- Start from the ground up
    - Konga.com is a great example. another one...
- Build a simple version
    - Airberlin.com (loadtime is < 1s)
    - Washington Post (loadtime is <80ms)
- Focus on a single feature at a time
    - Weather Channel brought in push notifications
    - Booking.com
    - **they are just showing off all the apps built using PWA now...**
